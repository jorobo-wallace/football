# football

A set of lambda functions deployed with serverless. 

The lambda set will provide various data from the current or previous NFL season. Lambdas can easily be modified to be called as functions, or to plugin to the AWS API Gateway
to return from HTTP requests.

Lambdas are set up to be modular to easily expand on functionality.

NOTE: Require API key for NFL API for use
